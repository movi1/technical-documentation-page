                <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
                    It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

                    This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories,
                    branches, commits, and pull requests.
                    You'll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub's
                    pull request workflow,
                    a popular way to create and review code.</p>
                <p>In this quickstart guide, you will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create and use a repository</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Creating_a_repository">

            <article>
                <p>A repository is usually used to organize a single project.
                    Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos,
                    spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs.
                    Often, repositories include a README file,
                    a file with information about your project.
                    README files are written in the plain text Markdown language.
                    You can use this cheat sheet to get started with Markdown syntax.
                    GitHub lets you add a README file at the same time you create your
                    new repository. GitHub also offers other common options
                    such as a license file,
                    but you do not have to select any of them now.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources,
                        or even share and discuss things with others.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The main branch</li>
                    <li>A new branch called feature</li>

            <article>
                <p>When you created a new branch in the previous step,
                    GitHub brought you to the code page for your new readme-edits branch,
                    which is a copy of main.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Under the readme-edits branch you created, click the README.md file.</li>
                    <li>Click to edit the file.</li>
                    <li>In the editor, write a bit about yourself. Try using different Markdown elements.</li>
                    <li>In the Commit changes box, write a commit message that describes your changes.</li>
                    <li>Click to edit the file.</li>

                </ul>
            </article>

            <header><code><u>Opening a pull request</u></code></header>
            <article>
                <p>Now that you have changes in a branch off of main,
                    you can open a pull request.</p>
                <p>When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes
                    and requesting that someone review and pull in your
                    contribution and merge them into their branch.</p>
                <p>You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself.
                    It's a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Click the Pull requests tab of your hello-world repository.</li>
                    <li>Click New pull request</li>
                    <li>In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with main
                        (the original).</li>
                    <li>Click Create pull request.</li>
                    <li>Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.
                        You can include emojis and drag and drop images and gifs.</li>
                    <li>Click Create pull request.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <p>In this final step, you will merge your readme-edits branch into the main branch. After you merge
                    your pull request,
                    the changes on your readme-edits branch will be incorporated into main.</p>
                <p>In this walk-through, you should not have any conflicts,
                    so you are ready to merge your branch into the main branch.</p>


                <ul>
                    <li>Click Merge pull request to merge the changes into main. </li>
                    <li>Click Confirm merge. You will receive a message 
                        that the request was successfully merged and the request was closed.</li>
                    <li>Click Delete branch. Now that your pull request is merged and your changes are on main, you can safely delete the readme-edits branch. If you want to make more changes to your project,
                         you can always create a new branch and repeat this process..</li>
                   
                </ul>
